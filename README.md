# 📌 Shorts Blocker Chrome Extension  

🚀 **Block addictive short-form content** from YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and LinkedIn short videos.  
This extension helps users stay focused by completely removing short videos from their feed and redirecting them to a mindfulness page when they try to access such content.  

## 🛠️ Features  
✅ **Blocks** YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and LinkedIn short videos  
✅ **Removes the Shorts/Reels sections** from feeds to reduce temptation  
✅ **Redirects users** to a mindfulness page with an article and a timer  
✅ **Continuously runs in the background** to keep distractions away  

## 🔧 How It Works  
- **Content Removal:** The extension continuously checks for Shorts, Reels, and short videos, removing them from the page.  
- **Redirection:** If a user tries to access `youtube.com/shorts`, they are redirected to a **mindfulness page** (hosted separately) instead.  
- **Mindfulness Page:** This page provides insights on short-form content addiction, a customizable **focus timer**, and an option to return to productive content.
